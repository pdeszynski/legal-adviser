  "featureName": "I need to understand this issue better. Let me ask a clarifying question:\n\n**What exactly is not working?** \n\nIs the problem that:\n1. The user admin@refine.dev should have a \"super admin\" role but is getting \"client\" instead?\n2. The role is being read incorrectly from the user_roles relationship?\n3. The role assignment/seed data is incorrect?\n4. Something else in the role resolution logic?\n\nAlso, can you provide:\n- Where/how you're checking the role (GraphQL query, API endpoint, code location)?\n- What the expected behavior should be?\n- Any error messages or logs?\n\nThis will help me generate an accurate title for the actual problem we need to solve.",
