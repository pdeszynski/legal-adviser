# Project Memory Index

This folder contains agent learnings organized by category.
Categories are created automatically as agents work on features.

## How This Works

1. After each successful feature, learnings are extracted and categorized
2. Relevant memory files are loaded into agent context for future features
3. Usage statistics help prioritize which memories are most helpful

## Categories

- **architecture.md** - Core architectural patterns (CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture, DDD, Modular Monolith, Layered Architecture)
- **gotchas.md** - Mistakes and edge cases to avoid
- **api.md** - API design decisions and patterns
- **database.md** - Database schema and query patterns
- **testing.md** - Testing strategies and patterns
