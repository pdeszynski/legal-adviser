Test scenarios: 1) AI returns clarification JSON response, 2) Frontend correctly parses JSON and renders ClarificationMessage component, 3) Questions are displayed as bullet points with hints, 4) User can type answers or select from options (if provided), 5) Submit Answers button sends answers to backend, 6) Backend processes answers and returns final AI response, 7) Conversation history includes clarification round, 8) Multi-round clarification works (ask → answer → ask follow-up → answer → respond), 9) Context is preserved across clarification flow, 10) Error handling if clarification submission fails. Use Playwright to simulate full conversation flow requiring clarification.",
