Replace custom mutations and data provider calls with standard Refine hooks: useTable for listing, useShow for detail view, useEdit for editing, useCreate for user creation. Use @refinedev/nestjs-query's auto-generated CRUD operations from User entity. Configure resource in data provider following https://refine.dev/core/docs/data/data-provider/#usage-1. Example: https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/examples/data-provider-nestjs-query/src/pages/posts/list.tsx. This simplifies the admin code by leveraging nestjs-query's auto-generated resolvers for CRUD operations. User management is a pure CRUD admin task that fits this pattern perfectly - no complex domain logic, just standard user data operations.",
