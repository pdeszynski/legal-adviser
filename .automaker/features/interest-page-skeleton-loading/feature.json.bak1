Create skeleton placeholders matching the form layout: 1) Skeleton hero section with title and subtitle bars, 2) Skeleton form fields matching the actual form (name field, email field, company field, use case textarea, checkbox, submit button), 3) Apply shimmer animation effect for visual feedback, 4) Show skeleton immediately on page load before content/Form renders, 5) Transition smoothly from skeleton to actual form once page loads. Ensure skeleton matches the exact layout and spacing of the real form to prevent layout shift. Use existing skeleton loading patterns (loading-skeleton-components).",
