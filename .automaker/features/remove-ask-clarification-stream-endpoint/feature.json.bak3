Frontend will send clarification answers by: 1) Stringifying the answers object to JSON, 2) Setting message.type to 'CLARIFICATION_ANSWER', 3) Including the JSON string in the content field, 4) Backend will detect the type and process accordingly. This simplifies the AI Engine API by removing redundant endpoints. Update CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect that only /ask-stream endpoint exists.",
