Test scenarios: 1) Admin user (admin@refine.dev) can navigate to /admin/settings via menu link, 2) Admin user can access /admin/settings via direct URL, 3) Verify admin layout is displayed (sidebar, header with 'Admin Panel'), 4) Verify settings page content loads without redirecting to /dashboard, 5) Verify all settings tabs/sections are accessible, 6) Test that non-admin users (user@example.com) are redirected when attempting to access /admin/settings, 7) Test that unauthenticated users are redirected to /login, 8) Verify no console errors or GraphQL errors when accessing /admin/settings, 9) Test that settings page forms (profile, preferences, security) load correctly, 10) Verify role checking works for both ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles. Add test to apps/web/tests/admin-settings.spec.ts. This test ensures the fix for the redirect issue is maintained and prevents future regressions.",
