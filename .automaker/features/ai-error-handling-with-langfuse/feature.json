Implement: 1) Structured error types for different failure modes (LLM API errors, tool failures, validation errors), 2) Automatic Langfuse span annotation on errors with error context, 3) Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures, 4) Fallback agent behaviors when primary agent fails, 5) User-friendly error messages masking technical details, 6) Error aggregation in admin dashboard via Langfuse. Ensure all errors are traceable back to specific agents/workflows.",
