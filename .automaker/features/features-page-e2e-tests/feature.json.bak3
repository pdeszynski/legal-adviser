Test scenarios: 1) Page loads successfully without authentication, 2) All feature categories are displayed, 3) Feature cards render correctly with proper content, 4) Category filtering works (clicking categories filters the visible cards), 5) Search functionality finds features by name/description, 6) CTA buttons navigate to correct destinations (demo pages, docs, or authenticated routes), 7) Page is responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop viewports, 8) Navigation menu 'Features' link routes to /features, 9) Breadcrumb navigation works correctly, 10) Skeleton loading appears before content loads. Use Playwright testing patterns consistent with existing E2E tests (e2e-test-two-factor-settings-enable-flow, e2e-tests-authorization-mutations, loading-skeleton-e2e-tests).",
