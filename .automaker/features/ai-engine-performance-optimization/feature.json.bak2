Implement: 1) Response caching for repeated queries (use Redis), 2) Token usage optimization via prompt engineering, 3) Batch processing for document generation, 4) Parallel agent execution where appropriate in LangGraph, 5) Model selection logic (GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, GPT-4 for complex reasoning), 6) Streaming responses for better UX. Use Langfuse metrics to identify bottlenecks. Implement cost monitoring alerts.",
