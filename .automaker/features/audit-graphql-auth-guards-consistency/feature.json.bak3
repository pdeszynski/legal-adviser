Verify: 1) All mutations require authentication (have @UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard) or equivalent), 2) All queries (except public ones) require authentication, 3) Admin-only mutations have additional @RequireRole or AdminGuard, 4) Guard execution order is correct (auth -> role -> permission), 5) Public resolvers are explicitly marked (e.g., @Public() decorator), 6) No authentication bypass exists via missing guards. Create checklist of all resolvers and their guard configuration. Fix any missing or inconsistent guards. Document authorization patterns in CLAUDE.md.",
