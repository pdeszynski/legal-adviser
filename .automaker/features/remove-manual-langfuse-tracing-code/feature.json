Tasks: 1) Search for manual Langfuse SDK usage (langfuse_sdk.create_span, langfuse_sdk.end_span, etc.), 2) Remove manual span creation in agent files, 3) Remove manual span creation in workflow files, 4) Keep only the official pydantic_ai.instrument_langfuse() call, 5) Ensure no duplicate tracing occurs, 6) Verify that all necessary context (user ID, session ID, metadata) is still captured through the official integration, 7) Clean up any unused Langfuse-related utility functions.",
