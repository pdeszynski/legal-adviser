Instrument: 1) All PydanticAI agent calls with tracing, 2) LangGraph workflow executions, 3) Tool usage (RAG retrieval, SAOS/ISAP API calls), 4) Token consumption and costs, 5) Latency measurements. Implement trace linking from frontend requests through backend to AI Engine. Create dashboards for monitoring: agent performance, workflow success rates, token usage trends, error rates. Add Langfuse middleware for automatic span creation. Ensure PII redaction in traces.",
