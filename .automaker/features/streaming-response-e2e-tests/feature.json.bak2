Test should: 1) Send a request to /ask endpoint with streaming enabled, 2) Measure time-to-first-token (should be < 1 second), 3) Verify tokens arrive incrementally over time (not all at once at end), 4) Record timestamps of each received token to prove streaming is real-time, 5) Test with a long-running query (5-10 seconds) to clearly see the streaming effect, 6) Verify the final 'done' event is received after all tokens. Use timing assertions to prove streaming works correctly.",
