  "description": "Fix the Next.js App Router file structure to ensure all /admin routes use AdminLayout consistently. The issue is likely that some admin pages have layout.tsx files that override the AdminLayout, or are missing the correct parent layout reference. Implementation: 1) Check apps/web/src/app/admin/layout.tsx exists and is properly configured, 2) Verify all admin sub-routes (users, templates, audit-logs, documents, api-keys, settings, analytics, etc.) are nested under admin/, 3) Remove any layout.tsx files from admin subdirectories that might be overriding the parent AdminLayout, 4) Ensure admin route group is properly structured, 5) Verify that pages directly under /admin inherit AdminLayout automatically. Goal: All /admin/* routes should show AdminLayout with admin navigation menu.",
