  "description": "Implement fix for /admin/settings page redirect issue based on root cause identified in analysis. Fix approaches based on findings: IF layout inheritance issue: Remove any layout.tsx from /admin/settings/ directory and ensure it inherits from /admin/layout.tsx. IF role validation issue: Fix role guard or client-side role check to correctly identify admin users - ensure user_roles array is checked for ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN role. IF route configuration issue: Fix Next.js App Router configuration or middleware that's incorrectly intercepting /admin/settings. IF navigation component issue: Fix any navigation guards or redirects in AdminLayout or settings page component. IF JWT token issue: Ensure admin user's token contains correct roles in user_roles claim. After fix: 1) Test navigation to /admin/settings via menu link works, 2) Test direct URL access to /admin/settings works, 3) Verify admin layout (sidebar, header) is displayed, 4) Verify settings page content loads correctly, 5) Test with admin@refine.dev user, 6) Test that non-admin users still get redirected. Add E2E test to prevent regression.",
