Test scenarios: 1) Clarification flow - verify agent asks questions instead of lawyer referral, 2) Multi-turn Q&A - verify conversation state maintained, 3) LangGraph workflows - verify multi-agent orchestration works, 4) PydanticAI agents - verify structured outputs are correct, 5) Langfuse traces - verify observability data is captured. Mock PydanticAI agents and LangGraph workflows where appropriate. Update test data to match new response formats.",
