  "description": "Update admin system overview dashboard to use the new adminDashboard GraphQL query instead of separate queries. Replace complex aggregation logic with calls to the unified stats endpoint. Ensure dashboard displays: total document count, documents by status (DRAFT, GENERATING, COMPLETED, FAILED), total users count, active sessions (if available), and legal query volume. Remove any redundant queries that are now covered by the stats endpoint. Maintain auto-refresh functionality (every 30 seconds). Update to use the new backend service that caches results for performance.",

Show total document count, documents currently generating (by status), completed vs failed document ratios, total users count, active sessions, estimated token usage (daily/monthly), AI query volume, and system health indicators. Implement auto-refresh every 30 seconds for real-time data. Create dedicated GraphQL queries aggregating statistics across all entities (LegalDocument, User, LegalQuery, UsageRecord). Display charts for token usage trends, document generation throughput, and user activity over time.",
