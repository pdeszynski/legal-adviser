  "description": "Refactor existing RAG implementation (currently using LangChain retrievers) into a PydanticAI tool pattern. Create RAG tool that: 1) Takes user query as input, 2) Performs vector search over legal documents/rulings, 3) Returns formatted context with citations, 4) Integrates cleanly with PydanticAI agents. Use direct vector store client (pgvector/Pinecone/Weaviate) instead of LangChain vector stores. Ensure tool is properly typed and traceable via Langfuse. Make RAG tool reusable across multiple agents (Q&A, classifier, document drafter).",
