Tasks: 1) Update hero section 'Get Started' CTA button to navigate to /early-access, 2) Update 'Request Early Access' button to navigate to /early-access (or scroll to form if on same page), 3) Add additional CTAs in strategic locations: after feature sections, in sticky header on scroll, and as exit-intent modal, 4) Ensure all buttons use Next.js Link component for proper client-side routing, 5) Add loading states on button click with instant feedback (within 100ms), 6) Prevent double-clicks during navigation with button disabled state, 7) Make sure NO CTAs mention 'demo' - use language like 'Get Early Access', 'Join Waitlist', 'Request Access'. Update landing-page-cta-integration feature to point to interest page instead of demo page.",
