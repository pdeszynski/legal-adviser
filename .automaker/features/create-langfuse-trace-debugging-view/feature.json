Implementation: 1) Add backend endpoint GET /api/admin/debug/langfuse/traces with query parameters: userId, sessionId, agentName, dateRange, 2) Use Langfuse public API or SDK to fetch filtered traces, 3) Return simplified trace data: trace_id, agent name, user ID, session ID, timestamp, token usage, latency, status, 4) Add frontend admin page at /admin/debug/langfuse-traces for viewing traces, 5) Implement filters: by user, by session ID, by agent type, by date range, 6) Show trace details on click: span tree, token counts, error messages, metadata, 7) Add 'View in Langfuse' link to open full trace in Langfuse dashboard, 8) Apply admin-only access control. This provides operational visibility without logging into Langfuse directly.",
