Test scenarios: 1) Admin user logs in and sees admin links (menu-admin-panel-link), 2) Admin user can access /admin routes, 3) Non-admin user cannot access admin routes (403), 4) GraphQL me query returns user_roles array with correct roles, 5) Frontend useUserRole hook returns correct roles array, 6) Backend guards correctly authorize based on user_roles, 7) User with multiple roles has all permissions, 8) Seed users (admin@refine.dev, user@example.com) have correct roles, 9) Role checks in components work correctly, 10) Menu items show/hide based on roles. These tests ensure the single user_roles mechanism works end-to-end.",
