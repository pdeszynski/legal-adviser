Audit all usages across the codebase to understand which approach is used where. Check: User entity definition, UserRole entity definition, GraphQL resolvers referencing roles, Frontend role checks (useUserRole hook), RBAC guards (RoleGuard, AdminGuard), Seed data creation, Migration files. Document which tables/columns are actively used vs deprecated. Identify any inconsistencies where code reads from User.role vs UserRole relationship. Create a matrix showing all role-related code paths and which data source they use. This analysis will determine whether to keep the many-to-many approach (User + UserRole + Role tables) or simplify to single role column on User table.\n\n---\n\n## Task Description\n\nUpdate seeds to make sure the roels are created, add role to admin@refine.dev as a super admin.
