Update all PydanticAI agents (classifier_agent, qa_agent, drafting_agent, clarification_agent) to have clear, human-readable names that appear in Langfuse dashboard. Format: 'legal-classifier', 'legal-qa', 'legal-drafter', 'legal-clarification'. Update agent initialization to set explicit names that align with business domain. Ensure agent names are consistent across traces for filtering and grouping in Langfuse UI.",
